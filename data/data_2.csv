In October 1979 the Tatros filed an action against the district the Texas State Board of Education and others They sought an injunction requiring the district to provide Amber with CIC They also sought damages and attorneys fees through the Rehabilitation Act RA which forbade programs receiving federal aid from excluding handicapped people from participation and allowed prevailing parties to recover attorneys fees The district court denied the Tatros request for a preliminary injunction concluding that CIC was not a related service under the EHA because it did not arise from an effort to educate The United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit reversed holding that CIC was indeed a related service under the EHA and remanded the case to the district court The district court then ruled that CIC was not a medical service under the EHA because a doctor was not needed to administer the procedure It found that CIC was a related service and ordered the defendants to modify Ambers individualized education program accordingly It also held that the Tatros had proved a violation of the RA The Fifth Circuit affirmed both holdings

AlvarezMachain then filed a group of civil suits in federal court against the United States and the Mexican nationals who had captured him under the Federal Tort Claims Act FTCA which allows the federal government to be sued on tort claims and the Alien Tort Statute ATS which permits suits against foreign citizens in American courts The government argued that the FTCA applied only to claims arising from actions that took place in the United States and therefore did not cover AlvarezMachains case because the arrest took place in Mexico Further the government and the Mexican nationals argued that the ATS gave federal courts jurisdiction to hear tort claims against foreign citizens but did not allow private individuals to bring those suits
The federal district court disagreed with the governments contention that the FCTA claim did not apply finding that plan to capture AlvarezMachain was developed on US soil and therefore covered However the court then ruled that the DEA had acted lawfully when they arrested AlvarezMachain and was therefore not liable On the ATS claims the court rejected the argument that private individuals could not bring suit under the Act The court found that Jose Francisco Sosa one of the Mexican nationals who kidnapped Alvarez Machain had violated international law and was therefore liable under the ATS

Using the reasoning from the Atkins case the Missouri court decided 6to3 that the US Supreme Courts 1989 decision in Stanford v Kentucky which held that executing minors was not unconstitutional was no longer valid The opinion in Stanford v Kentucky had relied on a finding that a majority of Americans did not consider the execution of minors to be cruel and unusual The Missouri court citing numerous laws passed since 1989 that limited the scope of the death penalty held that national opinion had changed Finding that a majority of Americans were now opposed to the execution of minors the court held that such executions were now unconstitutional
On appeal to the US Supreme Court the government argued that allowing a state court to overturn a Supreme Court decision by looking at evolving standards would be dangerous because state courts could just as easily decide that executions prohibited by the Supreme Court such as the execution of the mentally ill in Atkins v Virginia were now permissible due to a change in the beliefs of the American people

"Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services, et al.",Heidi Ahlborn,"Heidi Ahlborn was injured and permanently disabled in a car accident She received Medicaid payments totaling 215645 through the Arkansas Department of Human Services ADHS to pay for her medical treatment In order to be eligible for the Medicaid payments Arkansas law required Ahlborn to give the ADHS the right to any settlement judgment or award she might receive because of the accident up to the amount Medicaid had paid for her treatment
Several years after the accident Ahlborn received 550000 in a settlement with the parties liable for her injuries The sum covered her medical treatment as well as pain and suffering lost earnings and her lost earning potential in the future Only 35581 of the settlement was earmarked for her medical treatment however When the ADHS demanded that she repay the full 215645 therefore Ahlborn refused and the issue went to a federal district court in Arkansas The judge sided with the ADHS ruling that it was not unreasonable for Arkansas to require Ahlborn to agree to repay them fully from any settlement she might receive in order to be eligible even if the portion specifically allocated for medical treatment was less than the amount demanded by Medicaid
An 8th Circuit Court of Appeals panel reversed however finding that seizing money from her settlement that had not been earmarked for medical treatment would violate federal Medicaid regulations which forbid state governments from seizing the property of Medicaid recipients in order to recover money spent on treatment The panel therefore ordered that Ahlborn repay just 35581 to the ADHS

The Defenders of Wildlife challenged the transfer arguing that the ESA imposed an authoritative independent requirement on the EPAs decision to approve the transfer The agency countered the ESA was not an independent source of authority Rather the ESA imposes requirements only on the discretionary decisions of federal agencies Since its decision was nondiscretionary under the CWA the agency argued the ESA did not apply The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Defenders of Wildlife and invalidated the transfer The Ninth Circuit found the FWS opinion legally flawed and the EPAs reliance on it arbitrary and capricious It noted that the EPAs decision was inconsistent with previous transfers of permitting authority in which the impact on endangered species was considered

Gary Lawrence,Florida,"Gary Lawrence was convicted of firstdegree murder and sentenced to death Lawrence appealed his conviction arguing that his counsel had been ineffective After exhausting his statecourt appeals Lawrence filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court to review the decisions of the Florida courts Later Lawrence petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus which would allow his appeal to be heard in federal court
The federal District Court rejected Lawrences habeas petition because he had exceeded the oneyear statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act AEDPA The AEDPA gives defendants one year to submit habeas petitions but that does not include any time that the petitioner has a properly filed application pending for State postconviction or other collateral review In Lawrences case whether or not he had exceeded the oneyear time limit depended on whether or not the time spent waiting for the Supreme Court to process his pending certiorari petition counted toward the time limit Federal Circuit Courts have disagreed on this question
In his appeal Lawrence argued that time spent on Supreme Court certiorari petitions like time spent on statecourt appeals was not countable toward the oneyear statute of limitations Lawrence also made an alternative argument that the incompetence of his stateappointed counsel as well as the disagreement among federal courts on the statute of limitations question constituted extraordinary circumstances If the Court were to find that the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the defendants control it could set aside the time limit under the doctrine of equitable tolling
The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the District Court and rejected Lawrences petition The Circuit Court ruled that Lawrence had failed to demonstrate how his lawyers actions or the confusion over the statute of limitations caused him to miss the deadline The Circuit Court acknowledged that the statute of limitations had been in dispute but it followed Circuit precedent that said time spent waiting for a pending Supreme Court certiorari petition did count toward the AEDPAs oneyear time limit

"Robert L.

After the jury sentenced Belmontes to death he appealed to the California Supreme Court arguing that the jury had misunderstood the ambiguous factor k instruction to mean that they should not consider noncrimerelated mitigating factors Since the Supreme Court has ruled that jurors must consider all mitigating evidence offered by a defendant in a capital case this would render the conviction unconstitutional The California Supreme Court upheld the conviction relying on Boyde v California in which the Supreme Court affirmed that factor k is constitutional unless there is a reasonable likelihood that jurors misunderstood it Belmondes appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where his death sentence was finally overturned in 2003 The Circuit Court ruled that jurors had been confused by the factor k instruction which caused them to fail to consider the mitigating evidence of Belmondess capacity for rehabilitation
After the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit for reconsideration the Circuit Court reaffirmed its decision in 2005 The Circuit Court held that the verbatim or unadorned reading of the factor k instruction would have misled a reasonable juror The Supreme Court agreed to consider the constitutional sufficiency of factor k as well as the possible retroactive applicability of the Circuit Courts holding

The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which reversed the lower court The Circuit Court ruled that the Westfall Act gives the courts power to settle factual disputes over the incident at issue in a lawsuit even if the dispute is over whether or not the incident happened at all The Sixth Circuit also ruled that the District Court should not have sent the case back to state court because the Westfall Act gives the federal courts jurisdiction over the case even after the federal District Court finds that the Attorney General was wrong to certify the federal employee
Osborn appealed to the Supreme Court which instructed the parties to submit briefs on the additional question of whether the Westfall Act gives a Court of Appeals the authority to review a District Courts order remanding a case back to state court

A federal District Court agreed and ruled the Act unconstitutional on both grounds The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit The government argued that the Act only bans a narrow category of abortion procedures and that a health exception is not required when Congress determines that a banned abortion procedure is never necessary for the health of the mother The Eighth Circuit disagreed and upheld the District Court ruling that a health exception is required for all bans on abortion procedures when substantial medical authority supports the necessity of the procedure The Circuit Court ruled that the ongoing disagreement among medical experts over the necessity of intact DampE abortions was sufficient to establish that the Act was unconstitutional without a health exception The Circuit Court did not reach the question of whether the Act was so broad as to qualify as an unconstitutional undue burden

Goodyear appealed citing a Title VII provision that requires discrimination complaints to made within 180 days of the employers discriminatory conduct The jury had examined Ledbetters entire career for evidence of discrimination but Goodyear argued that the jury should only have considered the one annual salary review that had occurred within the 180day limitations period before Ledbetters complaint

Lorenzo Jones sustained serious injuries in a car accident while in custody He sued prison officials in federal court claiming that they were violating his Eighth Amendment rights by making him do arduous work despite his injuries The officials moved to dismiss the suit because Jones had not provided any evidence or description of the administrative remedies he claimed to have pursued The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the suit
On appeal the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed The Circuit Court ruled that in order for Jones to sue he would have had to provide the court with copies of his grievance forms or at least describe the administrative processes he had exhausted The Circuit Court further ruled that the PLRA requires total exhaustion which means that if a prisoners suit has multiple claims administrative remedies must have been exhausted for each and every claim

The dispute centered on the degree of control exercised by the FTC over Philip Morris The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the lower courts ruling in favor of Philip Morris allowing the case to continue in the federal court system The Eighth Circuit held that the question of whether 28 USC 1442a1 applies depends on the detail and specificity of the federal direction of the defendants activities and whether the government exercises control over the defendant In the case of the tobacco industry the Eighth Circuit found unprecedented government involvement including detailed FTC regulations concerning the testing and disclosure of tar and nicotine levels Therefore Philip Morris was acting under a federal officer and consequently entitled to remove the case to federal court

Andre Wallace,Chicago Police Officers Kristen Kato and Eugene Roy,"In 1994 Andre Wallace was arrested and charged with murder Two years later he was convicted and sent to prison Wallace appealed arguing that the police had arrested him without probable cause and coerced him into confessing to the crime In 1998 an appeals court agreed that Wallace had been arrested without probable cause and granted him a new trial Finally in 2002 the prosecution dropped its case against him The next year Wallace sued the police officers and the city of Chicago for violating his Fourth Amendment rights through false arrest
The District Court ruled against Wallace because his suit was timebarred In Illinois there is a twoyear statute of limitations on falsearrest claims Since Wallace had not brought suit within two years of either his arrest or the time the arrest was declared invalid his time was up Wallace appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals arguing that the twoyear limit did not begin until his conviction was finally set aside in 2002
The Circuit Court upheld the District Court ruling against Wallace The Circuit Court panel acknowledged that other Circuits had failed to agree on the question of when the statute of limitations for a false arrest claim should begin The Seventh Circuit opted for a clear rule  the twoyear limit starts at the time of the arrest and therefore Wallaces suit was too late

When Michigan attempted to exercise its regulatory powers over Wachovia Mortgage Wachovia Bank sued Watters a Michigan official seeking a judgment that Michigans laws on operating subsidies of national banks were superceded by 12 USC Section 484a Michigan argued that the OCC had exceeded the authority given it by Congress by extending the definition of national bank to cover stateregistered operating subsidiaries Michigan also argued that the extension of federal authority over state entities like Wachovia Mortgage violates the Tenth Amendment which reserves to states all powers not delegated to the federal government
The District Court rejected these arguments and ruled for Wachovia and the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed The Circuit Court found that the decision of the OCC to apply rules for national banks to their operating subsidiaries was a reasonable interpretation of Congresss intent and therefore entitled to deference under Chevron USA v Natural Resources Defense Council The Sixth Circuit also held that Congress had the power to regulate operating subsidiaries of national banks under the Commerce Clause so the Tenth Amendment did not reserve that power to the states

Parents Involved In Community Schools,Seattle School District No. 1 et al.,"The Seattle School District allowed students to apply to any high school in the District Since certain schools often became oversubscribed when too many students chose them as their first choice the District used a system of tiebreakers to decide which students would be admitted to the popular schools The second most important tiebreaker was a racial factor intended to maintain racial diversity If the racial demographics of any schools student body deviated by more than a predetermined number of percentage points from those of Seattles total student population approximately 40 white and 60 nonwhite the racial tiebreaker went into effect At a particular school either whites or nonwhites could be favored for admission depending on which race would bring the racial balance closer to the goal

Section 502a2 allows plan participants to sue plan administrators for breach of fiduciary duty in order to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach DeWolff argued that LaRues suit was not of the type contemplated by the text of ERISA because LaRue sued to recover losses caused to his own personal retirement plan rather than suing to vindicate the interests of the plan as a whole LaRue also invoked Section 502a3 which allows plan participants to sue to obtain other appropriate equitable relief
The US District Court held that LaRue was not entitled to relief under ERISA and the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed The Fourth Circuit ruled that Section 502a2 was concerned with protecting entire plans from misuse of plan assets and not with providing recovery for losses suffered by individual accounts The court also rejected LaRues Section 502a3 claim It ruled that the phrase equitable relief rarely includes relief in the form of a monetary award and only when the money has been unjustly possessed by the defendant

Jose Ernesto Medellin,State of Texas,"Jose Medellin a Mexican national was convicted and sentenced to death for participating in the gang rape and murder of two teenage girls in Houston Medellin raised a postconviction challenge arguing that the state had violated his rights under the Vienna Convention a treaty to which the United States is a party Article 36 of the Vienna Convention gives any foreign national detained for a crime the right to contact his consulate After his petition was ultimately dismissed by the Supreme Court see Medellin v Dretke  Medellins case returned to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Medellins argument rested in part on a ruling of the International Court of Justice ICJ holding that the US had violated the Vienna Convention rights of 51 Mexican nationals including Medellin and that their convictions must be reconsidered Medellin argued that the Vienna Convention granted him an individual right that state courts must respect a possibility left open by the Supreme Courts 2006 decision in SanchezLlamas v Oregon Medellin also cited a memorandum from the President of the United States that instructed state courts to comply with the ICJs rulings by rehearing the cases Medellin argued that the Constitution gives the President broad power to ensure that treaties are enforced and that this power extends to the treatment of treaties in state court proceedings
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected each of Medellins arguments and dismissed his petition The court interpreted SanchezLlamas as standing for the principle that rulings of the ICJ are not binding on state courts The Texas court stood by its position that allowing Medellin to raise the Vienna Convention issue after his trial would violate state procedural rules and that those rules were not supplanted by the Convention The President had no authority to order the enforcement in state court of an ICJ ruling because that would imply a lawmaking power not allocated to him by the Constitution

On appeal the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the tax court The court cited Section 67es requirement that a trusts fees are only fully deductible when they would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust The provision was meant to exempt special administrative expenses that are incurred by trusts Therefore the court ruled costs that could possibly be incurred by individual taxpayers as well as trusts were never deductible in full Since an individual could pay for investmentadvice services and since the individuals payment would not be fully deductable Section 67e did not exempt a trusts payment for the same services

Futures, Inc.",Board of Trade of the City of New York et al.,"In his role as chairman of a settlement committee of the Board of Trade of the City of New York Norman Eisler allegedly manipulated the daily settlement prices of commodities futures in order to conceal bad investments During this period Eislers company purchased futures contracts through its broker the commodity futures merchant Klein amp Co Futures Inc but the alleged price manipulation distorted Kleins appraisal of Eislers ability to pay When the scheme unravelled Eislers company could not meet its obligations and Klein was forced to absorb the loss
Klein sued Eisler and the Board of Trade under Section 22 of the Commodities Exchange Act CEA claiming that the Board of Trade failed to enforce rules that would have prevented the manipulation The CEA requires boards of trade to set rules governing the market and Section 22 allows private parties to sue for failure to enforce the rules as long as the party was engaged in any transaction subject to the boards rules
The US District Court dismissed Kleins claim for lack of standing to sue and the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed The Second Circuit interpreted Section 22 as including buyers and sellers of futures contracts but excluding the commodity futures merchants who conduct the actual trades on behalf of their customers The court ruled that Kleins financial loss was not sufficient to grant it standing because the loss was suffered in the aftermath of the futures trading and not during the trading itself

In 2006 Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 MCA The Act eliminates federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas applications from detainees who have been designated according to procedures established in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 as enemy combatants When the case was appealed to the DC Circuit for the second time the detainees argued that the MCA did not apply to their petitions and that if it did it was unconstitutional under the Suspension Clause The Suspension Clause reads The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it
The DC Circuit ruled in favor of the government on both points It cited language in the MCA applying the law to all cases without exception that pertain to aspects of detention One of the purposes of the MCA according to the Circuit Court was to overrule the Supreme Courts opinion in Hamdan v Rumsfeld which had allowed petitions like Boumedienes to go forward The DC Circuit held that the Suspension Clause only protects the writ of habeas corpus as it existed in 1789 and that the writ would not have been understood in 1789 to apply to an overseas military base leased from a foreign government Constitutional rights do not apply to aliens outside of the United States the court held and the leased military base in Cuba does not qualify as inside the geographic borders of the US In a rare reversal the Supreme Court granted certiorari after initially denying review three months earlier

The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the imposition of the death sentence noting that although the US Supreme Court had struck down capital punishment for rape of an adult woman in Coker v Georgia that ruling did not apply when the victim was a child Rather the Louisiana high court applied a balancing test set out by the Court in Atkins v Virginia and Roper v Simmons first examining whether there is a national consensus on the punishment and then considering whether the court would find the punishment excessive In this case the Louisiana Supreme Court felt that the adoption of similar laws in five other states coupled with the unique vulnerability of children justified imposing the death penalty
In seeking certiorari Kennedy argued that five states do not constitute a national consensus for the purposes of Eighth Amendment analysis that Coker v Georgia should apply to all rapes regardless of the age of the victim and that the law was unfair in its application singling out black child rapists for death at a significantly higher rate than whites

"Hall Street Associates, L.L.C.","Mattel, Inc.","Toy manufacturer Mattel was sued by its landlord Hall Street Associates in a dispute over a property lease After the litigation went to federal court both parties agreed to resolve the case by arbitration according to the procedures outlined in the Federal Arbitration Act FAA Atypically the parties arbitration agreement stipulated that the District Court could override the arbitrators decision if the arbitrators conclusions of law are erroneous This provision of the agreement granted the federal courts a much broader role in supervising the arbitration than is specifically granted in the FAA The Act explicitly mentions only a narrow set of circumstances under which courts can override an arbitration award such as corruption partiality or misbehavior on the part of the arbitrator
The arbitrator heard the parties arguments and handed down a decision in favor of Mattel Hall sought review from the District Court and that court found that the arbitrators decision contained legally erroneous conclusions Accordingly the arbitrator ruled for Hall Street and the District Court affirmed
On appeal the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the original arbitration award favoring Mattel must stand Even if the arbitrator did make legal errors it was not the place of the courts to review the soundness of the arbitrators decision The Ninth Circuit viewed the FAAs list of circumstances meriting judicial review as an exclusive list As far as the original arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review of the arbitration the agreement could not be enforced

Michael A. Watson,United States,"Michael Watson was arrested for trading illegal drugs for an unloaded semiautomatic pistol He was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 262 months in prison Since Watsons crime involved a gun his sentence included an additional 60 months The extra jail time was imposed under 18 USC 924c1A which punishes any drug trafficker who uses or carries a firearm during a drug deal In Smith v United States the Supreme Court had ruled that a defendant who trades a gun for drugs uses it for purposes of the statute However the Court clarified in Bailey v United States that use means active employment of a firearm mere possession of the firearm does not necessarily constitute use
On appeal Watson argued that the firearm was not used in his case He stressed that the gun was never loaded and was in his possession for only moments before he was arrested The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected Watsons arguments and affirmed the lower court Following Circuit precedents it ruled that Watson had used the gun under the statutes meaning of use

United States,Efrain Santos and Benedicto Diaz,"For his role in running an illegal lottery or bolita Efrain Santos was convicted on charges of illegal gambling and money laundering Santos had used income from the lottery to pay both the winners and the couriers and collectors who worked for the gambling operation The money laundering charges were based on 18 USC 1956a1 which criminalizes the use of the proceeds of an illegal activity to promote or conceal that activity However federal courts disagreed on the meaning of proceeds The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had ruled that the proceeds used in money laundering can be any of the gross income obtained from the illegal activity but the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which had jurisdiction over Santoss case had recently ruled that only net income gross revenues minus expenses used to promote or conceal illegal activities can be the basis of a money laundering conviction Because Santos had only used gross revenues to promote his lottery the District Court reversed the convictions
The government argued on appeal that the Seventh Circuits interpretation would put too great a burden on prosecutions because the bookkeeping of criminal operations is often purposefully incomplete or misleading in order to obscure the distinction between gross and net income The narrow interpretation would also restrict money laundering prosecutions to criminal enterprises that are actually profitable Santos countered that the governments broad interpretation would result in overlapping convictions for a wide variety of offenders charged with both money laundering and the underlying crime He argued that the governments interpretation strayed too far from the traditional understanding of money laundering which focuses on the subsequent disguising of profits obtained from a criminal venture The Seventh Circuit ruled for Santos and affirmed its original ruling

A US district court ruled that the school district was not required by the IDEA to reimburse Freston because Gilbert had never been enrolled in public school The relevant section of the IDEA authorizes tuition reimbursement to the parents of a disabled child who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency but it does not explicitly state that parents of children who have never received public education are not entitled to reimbursement The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the district court By comparing the disputed section of the IDEA with other sections of the statute the Second Circuit reasoned that the IDEA was not meant to deny reimbursement to students who have never been enrolled in public school To rule otherwise the Circuit Court held would be to require parents like Freston to enroll children in inadequate public schools in order to be eligible for tuition reimbursement

The district court initially dismissed APCCs suit but the court eventually reversed itself concluding that it was sufficient that the assignment transferred legal title to the claim rather than merely transferring power of attorney The US Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit affirmed concluding that as a matter of law the assignment of a legal right to bring a claim gives the assignee a personal stake in the litigation sufficient to confer standing

In John R Sands appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit the issue of the statute of limitations was raised again  not by either of the parties but by a group of corporations who were not parties to the case Citing its own precedents the Federal Circuit ruled that the statute of limitations was jurisdictional Jurisdictional requirements determine whether courts can hear a case They cannot be waived by the parties to the case and courts can consider jurisdictional issues on the courts own initiative The Federal Circuit ruled that John R Sands claim accrued no later than 1994 Since the suit fell outside the time limit the Federal Circuit ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and it dismissed the case without considering the merits of the Fifth Amendment claim

AT&T Corporation,Noreen Hulteen et al.,"Four employees sued their employer ATampT alleging that the companys policy for calculating employee pension and retirement benefits discriminated against women who had taken leave time due to pregnancy in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act The ATampT policy considered temporary disability leave as service time for the purposes of calculating retirement benefits except when the leave was taken by pregnant women The employees argued that the policy violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 PDA which clarified that Title VII prohibits discrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy childbirth or related medical conditions The main issue in the case was one of timing although the employees pregnancy leave was taken before the PDA came into effect ATampTs calculation of benefits took place after The employees argued that under the Courts decision in Pallas the time of calculation should govern the applicability of the PDA ATampT countered that another decision Landgraf directly opposed Pallas and had created a sea change in retroactivity principles such that the PDA should not apply to pregnancy leave taken before it was enacted The district court sided with the employees and granted summary judgment in their favor
On appeal the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit initially reversed the lower court agreeing with ATampT that Pallas gave impermissible retroactive effect to the PDA On rehearing the full court reversed and ruled in favor of the employees avoiding the retroactivity problem by holding that the PDA applies to the actual calculation of pension and retirement benefits regardless of when the leave itself was taken Because ATampT performed this calculation after the PDA had gone into effect the denial of benefits violated Title VII

"Gary Bartlett, Executive Director of North Carolina State Board of Elections, et al.",Dwight Strickland et al.,"Dwight Strickland a commissioner in Pender County NC along with several other county commissioners brought this suit against state officials alleging that their redistricting plan was in violation of the North Carolina Constitution The state officials argued that the redistricting plan was required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 VRA stating that the minority group in question comprised of AfricanAmerican North Carolina citizens was sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority under the terms of the VRA The North Carolina Superior Court agreed with the state officials and entered summary judgment in their favor

The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit refused to grant Chambers relief Finding that Chambers had knowingly failed to report to a penal institution on several occasions the equivalent of an actual escape under Illinois law the court affirmed his sentence Although the court determined that its precedents compelled such a ruling the opinion indicated that more research would be needed to determine the desirability of classifying all escapes and failures to report as crimes of violence For the time being however the court perpetuated Illinois rule that felonious escape of any kind qualifies as a crime of violence for the purposes of the ACCA

Arizona,Rodney Joseph Gant,"Rodney Gant was apprehended by Arizona state police on an outstanding warrant for driving with a suspended license After the officers handcuffed Gant and placed him in their squad car they went on to search his vehicle discovering a handgun and a plastic bag of cocaine At trial Gant asked the judge to suppress the evidence found in his vehicle because the search had been conducted without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendments prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures The judge declined Gants request stating that the search was a direct result of Gants lawful arrest and therefore an exception to the general Fourth Amendment warrant requirement The court convicted Gant on two counts of cocaine possession
The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed holding the search unconstitutional and the Arizona Supreme Court agreed The Supreme Court stated that exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement must be justified by concerns for officer safety or evidence preservation Because Gant left his vehicle voluntarily the court explained the search was not directly linked to the arrest and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment In seeking certiorari Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard argued that the Arizona Supreme Courts ruling conflicted with the Courts precedent as well as precedents set forth in various federal and state courts

Arthur Andersen LLP et al.,Wayne Carlisle et al.,"After Wayne Carlisle and his partners Carlisle sold their construction equipment business they hired multiple consultants in order to set up a tax shelter for the proceeds The IRS later determined the tax shelter was illegal but offered amnesty under certain conditions Carlisle was never informed of these developments and was ultimately required to pay taxes and penalties that exceeded 25 million Carlisle filed suit in a federal district court against nine parties alleging fraud negligence civil conspiracy and breach of fiduciary duty
Before trial one of the defendants motioned to stay the proceedings pending arbitration with Carlisle per a written agreement with Carlisle Stay was granted The remaining defendants motioned seeking their own stay arguing that allowing one party to arbitrate with Carlisle and not allowing the rest would be contradictory The district court denied the motion On interlocutory appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied it had jurisdiction to review the matter The parties then appealed the denial of jurisdiction They argued that Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act FAA applies and makes available a stay of proceedings in order to arbitrate when there is a written agreement that directs litigated issues into arbitration Section 16a1 of the FAA then grants appellate jurisdiction over Section 3 motions
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that Section 16a1 did not confer jurisdiction in this case The court recognized that the appellants were not signatories to the arbitration agreement with Carlisle Thus it reasoned there was no written agreement that could direct litigated issues into arbitration Since the appellants motion to stay was not rooted in Section 3 Section 16a1 did not grant appellate jurisdiction

"Priscilla Summers, et al.","Earth Island Institute, et al.","Earth Island Institute along with several other environmental groups filed suit against the United States Forest Service in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California alleging that certain Forest Service regulations violated the Forest Service Decision Making and Appeals Reform Act ARA The ARA requires the Forest Service to establish an administrative appeals process providing an opportunity for notice and comment Earth Island brought this claim when in 2003 the Forest Service issued new regulations greatly limiting notice appeals and public comment on certain categorically excluded activities The district court found for the plaintiffs and issued a nationwide injunction against the Forest Service
The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courts ruling holding that if Congress intended to allow the Forest Service to limit notice appeals and comment for categorically excluded activities as the regulations did it would not have enacted the ARA in the first place In seeking certiorari the Forest Service argued that the Ninth Circuit had overstepped its bounds in invalidating the regulations and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit because the case was not yet ripe for judicial review

Citizens United,Federal Election Commission,"Citizens United sought an injunction against the Federal Election Commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to prevent the application of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act BCRA to its film Hillary The Movie The Movie expressed opinions about whether Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton would make a good president
In an attempt to regulate big money campaign contributions the BCRA applies a variety of restrictions to electioneering communications Section 203 of the BCRA prevents corporations or labor unions from funding such communication from their general treasuries Sections 201 and 311 require the disclosure of donors to such communication and a disclaimer when the communication is not authorized by the candidate it intends to support
Citizens United argued that 1 Section 203 violates the First Amendment on its face and when applied to The Movie and its related advertisements and that 2 Sections 201 and 203 are also unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances
The United States District Court denied the injunction Section 203 on its face was not unconstitutional because the Supreme Court in McConnell v FEC had already reached that determination The District Court also held that The Movie was the functional equivalent of express advocacy as it attempted to inform voters that Senator Clinton was unfit for office and thus Section 203 was not unconstitutionally applied Lastly it held that Sections 201 and 203 were not unconstitutional as applied to the The Movie or its advertisements The court reasoned that the McConnell decision recognized that disclosure of donors might be unconstitutional if it imposed an unconstitutional burden on the freedom to associate in support of a particular cause but those circumstances did not exist in Citizen Uniteds claim

The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed with the district court holding that Discover was the real party in interest and that Vadens claims were therefore preempted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act Furthermore Vaden had failed to overcome the presumption that she received the properly mailed arbitration agreement Based on these conclusions the Ninth Circuit granted Discovers motion to compel arbitration

Pacific Bell Telephone Co.,LinkLine Communications,"LinkLine along with several other internetservice providers ISPs sued Pacific Bell claiming that the company was selling digital subscriber line DSL access at a high wholesale price in relation to the price at which it was providing retail services The ISPs condemned the scheme as price squeezing in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act a piece of US antitrust legislation designed to prevent the formation of monopolies A price squeeze occurs when a company holding a monopoly on the production of certain goods sets its wholesale prices higher than the retail prices it charges directly to consumers preventing the wholesale customers from competing with it at the retail level The district court denied Pacific Bells motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a valid claim but granted its motion for an interlocutory appeal allowing the appellate court to determine whether such price squeezing claims are permissible before delivering a final judgment at the trial level
The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that the ISPs had stated a legitimate price squeezing claim under Section 2 The Ninth Circuit argued that prior Supreme Court precedent had not eliminated the application of traditional antitrust laws to partially regulated industries While noting that the wholesale market is governed by a separate document the 1934 FCC Act the court stated that the retail market remains unregulated and is therefore subject to the antitrust laws As far as the retail market was concerned then the ISPs had stated a valid price squeezing claim under Section 2

Gary Bradford Cone,"Ricky Bell, Warden","This is the third habeas corpus appeal of petitioner Gary Bradford Cone after his 1982 conviction in a Tennessee state court on several felony counts including first degree murder and robbery by use of deadly force The jury found that Cone had bludgeoned two elderly people to death while hiding out after a robbery Cones initial appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court soon following his conviction fell on deaf ears the court ruled that although errors had been committed during the trial each of them had been harmless and did not warrant overturning Cones conviction He responded by twice filing habeas corpus petitions alleging violations of several constitutional rights appealing both all the way up to the Court but both times having his case remanded with in his view several of his claims still unresolved
In his third appearance before the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Cone raised two main points of contention First he claimed that he was entitled to relief because the jury in his trial had weighed invalid aggravating factors during his sentencing hearing thereby entitling him to a new hearing This argument was rejected by the Sixth Circuit which found that the Tennessee Supreme Court had conducted a satisfactory harmless error test on the issue The court pointed out that habeas petitions should be granted only after finding that a state court ruling has resulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law Because Tennessee had not abridged any federal laws the Sixth Circuit denied Cone relief on this first issue
Cone also argued that the Sixth Circuit had erred when in a previous appeal it had held that his claims relating to the prosecutors improper withholding of evidence had been procedurally defaulted Cone argued that his case met the Courts exceptional circumstances test as set out in Westside Mothers v Olszewski for overruling the procedural default rule and rehearing the issue The Sixth Circuit once again disagreed ruling that Cone had failed to show cause and prejudice on the part of the prosecutor The Sixth Circuit denied Cones habeas appeal on all counts

The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the district courts ruling that the payroll deduction provisions could not be applied to private and local government employees because the State had provided no compelling justification to do so Furthermore the court stated that the officials had failed to show that the case should be reviewed under the more relaxed standard for a nonpublic forum

That night Troy drank at least ten shots of vodka followed by beer chasers he was so drunk that he vomited on himself after leaving a bar at 1215 am Two witnesses saw a man stumbling between the Browns trailer and that of Jane Does family around 100 am Jane Doe called her mother to report the rape at approximately 100 am according to Troy he returned to his trailer from the bar at approximately 130 am theoretically giving him enough time to assault Jane Doe
Troy Brown was arrested and charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child attempted murder and abuse and neglect of a child resulting in substantial mental harm
There was a large amount of conflicting evidence drawn from Jane Does testimony and from the crime scene itself Most relevantly the states expert tested semen taken from Jane Does underwear She determined that the DNA matched Troys and testified that the probability it belonged to another person from the general population was 1 in 3000000 Troy Browns family tested the semen independently and found a random match probability of 1 in 10000 but this was not introduced into evidence at trial The jury found Troy Brown guilty of sexual assault and abuse and neglect of a child and sentenced him to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 10 years
On appeal Brown argued that double jeopardy barred the duplication of sexual assault charges that the DNA evidence was improperly admitted and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction The Nevada Supreme Court vacated the charge for abuse and neglect and remanded to the trial court for sentencing The trial court again sentenced Brown to life in prison His petition for postconviction relief was denied
On appeal to the district court Brown claimed that the states evidence was legally insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt using the habeas corpus review developed by the Court in Jackson v Virginia Brown submitted a report prepared by Laurence Mueller a professor in ecology and evolutionary biology Mueller report The Mueller Report suggested that the prosecutions random match probability gave an improper impression that the likelihood of Troy Browns innocence was also 1 in 3000000 It also questioned the state experts testimony on the probability that one of Troy Browns brothers would match the DNA sample arguing that the likelihood of a match to one of Troys brothers was as high as 1 in 66 The district court supplemented the record with the Mueller Report as it was not presented to any state court
The district court then set aside the states DNA testimony as unreliable and held that no rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt The US Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courts ruling in a divided decision It held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by supplementing the record with the Mueller report and that the admission of the states DNA evidence was a due process violation and a violation of federal law

Alexander Vasquez,United States,"On August 5 2008 Joel Perez and Carlos Cruz drove to a Shell station in Arlington Heights Illinois with Cruz at the wheel They met with Alejandro Diaz who was working with Drug Enforcement Agency DEA officials Diaz instructed them to meet him at a different location to complete the deal Instead Perez walked to a nearby Dennys where Alexander Vasquez waited for him in the drivers seat of a black Pontiac Bonneville Perez got into the passenger seat of the Bonneville and called Cruz telling him that he was not willing to follow Diaz Cruz walked to the Dennys where he was introduced to Vasquez Diaz called Cruz to ask why they were not following him Cruz informed him that they wanted to complete the deal in the Dennys parking lot telling him We got the money here Vasquez echoed this statement
Diaz contacted his DEA handler Agent James Chupik Law enforcement agents surrounded the parking lot in their vehicles several officers approached the Bonneville to arrest Vasquez Cruz and Perez Cruz outside the car raised his hands in surrender Vasquez however immediately put the Bonneville into reverse striking two squad cars He then shifted gears and headed for an agent Agent Chupik stepped in front of the Bonneville and commanded Vasquez to stop but was forced to dive out of the way The Bonneville headed west on the eastbound lanes of Algonquin Road
Several minutes later police found the Bonneville abandoned in a Walmart parking lot A bystander told the police that he saw two men run from the vehicle into a McDonalds Vasquez and Perez ran into the McDonalds through its kitchen then split up Arlington Heights police officers quickly apprehended them however They found a cell phone on Vasquez and several cell phones on the ground near Perez records indicated several calls between Vasquezs cell phone and both phones apparently belonging to Perez Police impounded the Bonneville and later found 23000 in cash hidden in a secret compartment
A federal grand jury indicted Vasquez with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine and with attempting to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine At trial Agent Chupik testified that he instructed Diaz to have Cruz and his customers meet Diaz at a gas station in Arlington Heights In a transcript of the call between Cruz and Diaz however Cruz only referred to a single customer Vasquezs counsel attempted to impeach Agent Chupik on this point but the judge found the difference to be trivial limiting Vasquezs right to crossexamination and to refresh Agent Chupiks memory with the transcript The government introduced Vasquezs previous drug conviction into evidence to demonstrate Vasquezs intent he was convicted for dealing drugs with Perez in 2002
Vasquez called Perezs wife Marina as a witness to testify Marina Perez testified that she called Vasquez before the events in question to ask him to pick up Joel Perez at the site of the failed drug deal implying that Vasquez was there by coincidence In response the government introduced transcripts and audio recordings of conversations between Marina Perez and her husband as evidence of bias These indicated that Marina Perez spoke to her husband about a possible plea deal Marina Perez also mentioned that Vasquezs attorney had told her that everybody is going to lose The trial judge allowed these transcripts and recordings to be admitted to show Marina Perezs bias and for the truth of their contents
The jury found Vasquez guilty on the charge of conspiracy but not guilty on the charge of attempting to possess cocaine
The US Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit held that Vasquezs previous drug conviction was properly introduced into evidence The court rejected Vasquezs claim that the polices search of the Bonneville violated his Fourth Amendment rights noting that Vasquez abandoned the car and that the police had probable cause to believe that the money for the drug transaction was in the Bonneville The court also rejected Vasquezs claim that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to elicit testimony through the crossexamination of Agent Chupik The trial court found the distinction between customers and customer to be trivial and the court held this finding to be within the trial courts discretion
In a split decision the court turned to the testimony of Marina Perez holding that the evidence of conversations between Marina Perez and Vasquezs counsel were properly admitted to show bias and inconsistency with prior statements While noting that the judge improperly instructed the jury that the recordings could be considered as evidence of the truthfulness of their contents it held this instruction to be a harmless error It pointed to other overwhelming evidence of Vasquezs guilt including his attempt to escape capture and his previous conviction for drug dealing It held that the jury would have convicted Vasquez absent the introduction of the transcripts and recordings in question
Judge David Hamilton dissented on this point alone describing the recordings as prejudicial and inadmissible He reminded the majority that the error is only harmless if the court is convinced Vasquez would have been convicted absent the error He used a different test than the majority looking to whether or not the error contributed to the conviction He noted that Vasquez was never directly recorded or mentioned by name in any of the recordings and that government agents were not aware of his involvement until his arrest Judge Hamilton argued that Marina Perez testimony about Vasquez was thus plausible evidence of innocence without the recordings on record

Ramah Navajo Chapter entered into multiple ISDA contracts for the administration a number of federally funded programs The Ramah Navajo Chapter originally filed suit against the Secretary in 1990 on behalf of all BIA tribal contractors under the ISDA to challenge the methodology that Interiors Office of the Inspector General used to set indirect cost rates In 1999 the district court granted the plaintiffs leave to add a new claim for the alleged underpayment of contract support costs due to insufficient appropriations Both parties moved for summary judgment The district court eventually granted summary judgment for the government rejecting tribal demands for contract support costs in excess of the express statutory caps on the funds available to pay such costs
The tribes appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit reversed The appeals court held that the government could be required to pay all of the contract support costs requested by every tribal contractor even in excess of the statutory cap because Congress appropriated sufficient funds to satisfy the demands of any single contractor considered in isolation The government appealed the appellate courts decision

"National Federation of Independent Business, et al.","Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et al.","Amid intense public interest Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA which became effective March 23 2010 The ACA sought to address the fact that millions of Americans had no health insurance yet actively participated in the health care market consuming health care services for which they did not pay
The ACA contained a minimum coverage provision by amending the tax code and providing an individual mandate stipulating that by 2014 nonexempt individuals who failed to purchase and maintain a minimum level of health insurance must pay a tax penalty The ACA also contained an expansion of Medicaid which states had to accept in order to receive Federal funds for Medicaid and an employer mandate to obtain health coverage for employees
Shortly after Congress passed the ACA Florida and 12 other states brought actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida seeking a declaration that the ACA was unconstitutional on several grounds These states were subsequently joined by 13 additional states the National Federation of Independent businesses and individual plaintiffs Kaj Ahburg and Mary Brown
The plaintiffs argued that 1 the individual mandate exceeded Congress enumerated powers under the Commerce Clause 2 the Medicaid expansions were unconstitutionally coercive and 3 the employer mandate impermissibly interfered with state sovereignty
The District Court first addressed whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit It determined that Brown had standing to challenge the minimum coverage provision because she did not have health insurance and had to make financial arrangements to ensure compliance with the provision which would go into effect in 2014 The court further determined that Idaho and Utah had standing because each state had enacted a statute purporting to exempt their residents from the minimum coverage provision
The court also concluded that the AntiInjunction Act did not bar the suit
The District Court then addressed the constitutional questions It ruled that the individual mandate provision was not a valid exercise of Congress commerce or taxing powers The court held the entire act invalid because the mandate could not be severed from any other provision The court dismissed the states challenge to the employer mandates and granted judgment to the federal government on the Medicaid expansions finding insufficient support for the contention that the spending legislation was unconstitutionally coercive
A panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed 2to1 the District Courts holdings as to the Medicaid expansions and the individual mandate But it also reversed the District Court holding that the individual mandate could be severed without invalidating the remainder of the ACA

David Patchak a resident of Wayland Township filed suit against Ken Salazar the Secretary of the Department of the Interior on August 1 2008 taking advantage of a stay of the Secretarys action granted due to a separate suit against the Secretary by a Michigan antigambling organization Patchak alleged that the Bands gaming facility would destroy the peace and quiet of his community create pollution and increase crime The Band intervened as a defendant At trial the Secretary argued that the Quiet Title Act QTA precluded any person from seeking to divest the United States of title to Indian land trusts hence because the Bradley Tract was in trust while Patchaks suit was pending the district court did not have jurisdiction The court however dismissed Patchaks suit on the ground that he lacked standing to challenge Palazars authority under the IRA holding that Patchaks interests do not fall within the IRAs zoneofinterests
On appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed holding that Patchak fulfilled the zoneofinterests test for standing The court held that Patchak did not have to demonstrate that the statute was meant to benefit individuals in his situation pointing to portions of the IRA tasking the Secretary with considering affected members of the public before using his trust authority The court also rejected the Secretarys argument that the QTA barred Patchaks suit reasoning that Congress intended the QTA to limit actions in which the plaintiff claims an interest in property contrary to the governments interest In contrast Patchak did not seek sole possession of title to the Bradley Track Therefore the court held that his suit fell within the general waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act

Williams appealed claiming that the trial court abused its discretion when it removed juror number six because the removal of the lone holdout juror violated Williams Sixth Amendment right to a unanimous jury The California Court of Appeals rejected her claim as meritless and the California Supreme Court denied further direct appellate review

William Hoeper a pilot for Air Wisconsin made four unsuccessful attempts to become certified to fly another type of aircraft after Air Wisconsin discontinued use of the type of plane that Hoeper had previously piloted During his fourth and final opportunity to pass the test Hoeper abruptly ended the test because he believed that the test administrators were deliberately sabotaging his efforts to pass One test administrator knew that the Transportation Security Administration TSA had issued a firearm to Hoeper in his role as a federal flight deck officer FFDO FFDO pilots are not allowed to carry the firearm while traveling as passengers This administrator booked Hoeper on a flight from the testing center in Virginia to Hoepers home in Denver and then called the TSA to report that Hoeper was a disgruntled and possibly armed employee In response TSA officials arrested and searched Hoeper
Hoeper sued Air Wisconsin in a Colorado state court and alleged defamation under Virginia law Air Wisconsin moved for a directed verdict based on the argument that it was immune from civil liability under ATSA Air Wisconsin also argued that Hoeper could not prove actual malice because its statements were substantially true and therefore protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment The trial court denied the motion to dismiss The jury found that Air Wisconsins statements to the TSA were false and that it made at least one statement with reckless disregard for the truth so the jury awarded Hoeper damages A Colorado appellate court affirmed the verdict The Colorado Supreme Court held that the trial courts submission of the matter to the jury was improper however the error was harmless in this case because Air Wisconsin was not entitled to claim immunity under ATSA The Colorado Supreme Court further held that substantial evidence supported the jurys finding that the statements were false

Kansas,Jonathan and Reginald Carr,"In December 2000 brothers Jonathan and Reginald Carr committed a series of crimes in Wichita Kansas known as The Wichita Massacre which included assault robbery rape and the murder of five people The Carrs were prosecuted jointly They moved to sever their cases and argued that being tried jointly would be prejudicial because they intended to mount antagonistic defenses and introduce evidence that would be admissible or nonprejudicial only in separate trials The trial judge denied the motion and the Carrs were later jointly convicted on numerous counts and sentenced to death The jury instructions at the sentencing trial did not state that mitigating circumstances need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
On appeal the Carrs argued that their Eighth Amendment rights to individualized sentencing were violated both by the trial judges refusal to sever their cases and the failure to affirmatively instruct the jury that mitigating circumstances need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt The Kansas Supreme Court agreed and reversed the death sentences by holding that the trial judge failed to do the necessary analysis and carefully consider the severance issue The court also held that the jurors may have been prevented from giving meaningful effect to mitigating evidence because they were not instructed that mitigating circumstances need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt

Sam Umans,United States,"Sam Umans was a certified public accountant Between 1959 and 1961 the Internal Revenue Service audited six couples represented by Umans According to Louis R Deitsch an IRS employee Umans approached Deitsch before each audit to work something out together on it They agreed upon a disallowance for each audit and Umans gave Deitsch an envelope containing 50 for each case Five other IRS employees described similar transactions between the years 1961 and 1963 wherein smaller disallowances were given during audits followed by cash payments to the auditing IRS employees
Umans and the six IRS employees including Deitsch were indicted in August 1964 Umans was charged with aiding and abetting IRS employees in receiving illegal fees  He was also charged with giving money to government officials On March 25 1965 Umans and the six IRS employees were reindicted  The grand jury additionally charged Umans with giving money to government officials with the intent to influence their actions The evidence before the grand jury consisted solely of an IRS agent summarizing statements made by witnesses who would later testify at Umans trial At trial Umans requested access to statements made by the IRS employees that they took bribes from persons other than Umans the court denied this request and sealed the documents in question The governments case was based almost entirely on the testimonies of three of the IRS employees including that of Deitsch
Judge Sterry R Waterman writing for a unanimous United States Court of Appeals Second Circuit held that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the intent element of Umans charge for aiding and abetting IRS employees but that this instruction was not in plain error He held that the instruction was not sufficiently prejudicial noting that it was not objected to at trial Judge Waterman did however reverse the sentence for giving money to officials holding that this sentence could not be concurrent with the sentence for giving money to officials with intent to influence their actions He noted that the charges were identical but for the higher requirement of proof in the latter charge Looking to the statute itself Judge Waterman determined that Congress intended to make the charge for giving money to officials a lesser included offense
Judge Waterman held that the trial court properly excluded the IRS employees statements about taking bribes from other persons from the record He reasoned that it would have been within the courts discretion to prevent Umans from crossexamining the IRS employees on this subject for impeachment purposes as the government did not broach the subject during the employees direct examination Judge Waterman also held that the government properly indicted Umans with hearsay evidence holding that this evidence was competent He dismissed Umans concerns about inconsistencies between the evidence presented to the grand jury and evidence presented at trial He noted that Umans had access to affadavits used by the government to indict him thus he could have objected to any inconsistencies at trial but did not do so

The case at hand involves four collections of ancient Persian artifacts within the possession of the University of Chicago and Chicagos Field Museum of Natural History With few exceptions a foreign states property in the United States is immune from attachment and execution The plaintiffs argued before the district court that they should be able to attach and execute Irans property under subsections a and g of 28 USC  1610 as well as section 201 of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 TRIA The district court held and the Seventh Circuit agreed that while  1610a permits execution on a foreign states property used for a commercial activity in the United States that provision requires use by the foreign state itself not a third party such as a museum The district court also held and the Seventh Circuit agreed that  1610g permits attachment to property of a foreign state in aid of execution only in cases described elsewhere in  1610 rendering that provision unavailable to the plaintiffs in this case Finally the district court held and the Seventh Circuit agreed that  201 of TRIA applies only to assets blocked by executive order and in the absence of an executive order blocking the particular assets sought plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of that provision either

The officers asked whether Byrd had anything illegal in the car and then requested Byrds consent to search the car noting that they did not actually need his consent because he was not listed on the rental agreement The officers allege that Byrd gave his consent but Byrd disputes this contention The subsequent search turned up heroin and body armor in the trunk of the car
At trial Byrd moved to suppress the evidence challenging the initial stop the extension of the stop and the search The district court determined that the violation of the traffic law justified the initial stop and that the extension of the stop was justified by the officers developing reasonable suspicion of criminal activity Byrd maintains that he did not consent to the search so the issue remains whether he needed to consent at allthat is whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle despite not being listed on the rental agreement If he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy then the officers search of the vehicle did not require his consent

Minnesota had changed its probate code in 2002 to apply a revocationupondivorce statute to life insurance beneficiary designations Sveen had never changed the designation on his life insurance policy and Melin was therefore still listed as the primary beneficiary at the time of his death

"Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al.","Joe Mansky, et al.","Minnesota Statute  211BII prohibits individuals from wearing political apparel at or around polling places on primary or election days The text of the statute did not define political so Minnesota election officials distributed policy materials to help identify which items fell within the scope of the law Election officials received instructions to request that anyone wearing apparel which violated the guidelines laid out in the policy materials remove or cover it up While officials were instructed to allow the person to vote regardless of their compliance misdemeanor prosecution was a possible outcome should an individual refuse the removal or coverup request
This case arose when Andrew Cilek executive director for Minnesota Voters Alliance was temporarily prevented from voting at his local polling place in November 2010 because he was wearing a tshirt with a Tea Party logo and a button that advocated for the requirement of a photo ID to vote
Minnesota Majority Minnesota Voters Alliance and Minnesota Northstar Tea Party Patriots along with their association Election Integrity Watch EIW filed a lawsuit against the Minnesota Secretary of State and various county election officials to enjoin enforcement of the statute as unconstitutional The parties claimed that the statute violated the First Amendment facially and asapplied and was selectively enforced which also violated their Equal Protection rights
Initially the district court dismissed all claims The Eighth Circuit affirmed as to the claims regarding Equal Protection and facial First Amendment violations It reversed and remanded the asapplied First Amendment claim The district court ultimately granted summary judgment against EIW et al on the asapplied First Amendment claim Reviewing de novo the grant of summary judgment against EIW the Eighth Circuit considered EIWs claim that the Minnesota statute was not reasonable as applied to Tea Party apparel because the Tea Party is not a political party in Minnesota The Eighth Circuit was unpersuaded and held that the district court was correct in its ruling since EIW had failed to present specific facts that showed banning Tea Party apparel was not reasonable given the Minnesota statutes purpose The Eighth Circuit held that EIWs argument that voters in Tea Party apparel were affected by selective enforcement had also failed as it offered nothing more than speculation that voters wearing other forms of political apparel avoided enforcement of the statute EIW et al then petitioned the Supreme Court to decide whether the lower courts ruling was correct 
EIW indicates in their petition for a writ of certiorari that there is a circuit split on the issues presented where the Eighth Circuits ruling aligns with the DC and Fifth Circuit which both have held that the government has authority to ban forms of political speech near polling places The Fourth and Seventh Circuits have held by contrast that a complete ban on all political speech absent any limiting principle is unconstitutional regardless of the location in which such speech has been banned

The Lundgrens property had been in their extended family since approximately 1947 during which time they had always treated the fence as the property line In 2013 the Tribe purchased land to the north of the Lundgrens property and were apparently not aware of the fence at that time When they discovered it they informed the Lundgrens of their intention to assert ownership rights over the disputed portion of land 
In 2015 the Lundgrens filed suit to quiet title to the property seeking summary judgment on the basis that they had acquired the disputed property by adverse possession or mutual acquiescence and recognition long before the Tribe bought its parcel The Tribe moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity and because the Lundgrens could not join them as a necessary and indispensable party The trial court denied the Tribes motion and the Tribe sought direct discretionary review In the resulting ruling the court granted the Lundgrens motion for summary judgment finding that they had established legal ownership of the disputed property through adverse possession and mutual recognition and acquiescence
The Washington Supreme Court accepted the Tribes amended motion for discretionary review of both prior orders and affirmed The court rejected the argument that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to the Tribes sovereign immunity which neither the Tribe nor Congress had waived with regard to quiet title actions The court found that because it had in rem jurisdiction the Tribes sovereign immunity did not create a barrier to jurisdiction

Shareholders sued China Agritech in two successive putative class actions in 2011 and 2012 alleging various securities law violations against the company and several individual defendants Class certification was denied in both cases
Shareholder Michael Resh brought a third putative class action against the company and individual defendants in 2014 alleging securities law violations arising from the same facts and circumstances as the first two cases China Agritech moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that it had been filed after the two year limitations period applicable under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Resh and the additional plaintiffs argued that under the American Pipe amp Construction v Utah line of cases the limitations period had been tolled on their claims during the pendency of the two prior class actions The district court rejected this contention finding that under American Pipe and its progeny the limitations period was tolled as to individual class members but that the Supreme Court had not decided whether an entirely new class action based on a substantially identical class was subject to the same rule It ruled that the limitations period was therefore tolled as to the individual claims of the named plaintiffs in the instant case but not as to the putative class
The Ninth Circuit reversed with a threejudge panel finding that the plaintiffs class action would not be timebarred where 1 the named plaintiffs had been unnamed in the two prior suits which were against many of the same defendants and involved the same underlying events 2 the two prior cases were timely 3 class certification was denied in the earlier actions and 4 pursuant to the American Pipe line of cases the named plaintiffs individual claims were tolled during the pendency of the two prior class actions The panel explained that permitting such claims to go forward was consistent with the policy goals of tolling in general The panel further stated that in light of FRCP 23s requirements as well as principles of comity and preclusion the existing legal system contains sufficient safeguards to prevent litigants from filing repetitious actions in light of this ruling

"Greg Abbott, et al.","Shannon Perez, et al.","Individual voters in Texas along with organizations representing Latinos and African Americans filed a number of lawsuits in 2011 challenging the Texas legislatures congressional and state house redistricting plans The actions were consolidated and proceed in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas Texas District Court The plaintiffs alleged racial gerrymandering in violation of  2 of the Voting Rights Act VRA as well as the 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution At that time Texas was bound by the preclearance requirements under  5 of the VRA and therefore the State simultaneously filed an action in the US District Court for the District of Columbia DC District Court seeking preclearance of the redistricting plans 
While trial proceedings were pending in both district courts the 2012 primary elections were approaching As a result the Texas District Court assumed the task of implementing interim redistricting plans which it did on an expedited basis without access to all relevant facts and with the understanding that most parties to the litigation alleged that those plans contained many of the same statutory and constitutional infirmities as the challenged plans The US Supreme Court vacated the first iteration of the interim maps on the grounds that the court had not been sufficiently deferential to the legislature the Texas District Court issued more deferential plans in February 2012 
The DC District Court subsequently denied preclearance to the proposed redistricting plans on the basis that they were enacted with discriminatory intent and had the effect of abridging minority voting rights Texas appealed this decision to the US Supreme Court
After the Texas District Courts interim maps were used for the 2012 elections the Texas legislature failed to take any action on redistricting in the 2013 regular session However it convened a special session during which it adopted among others the Texas District Courts congressional interim map Plan C235 without any changes The governor subsequently signed the legislation adopting this plan
In June 2013 the US Supreme Court decided Shelby County v Holder which removed the  5 preclearance requirements from the VRA Texas was therefore no longer automatically subject to preclearance requirements and the US Supreme Court later vacated and remanded for further proceedings the DC District Courts preclearance decision which the lower court then dismissed as moot
The defendants subsequently sought to dismiss the plaintiffs claims in the Texas District Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the case had become moot In response the plaintiffs expressed their desire to amend their complaints regarding the 2011 plans and to challenge the 2013 plans The court granted them leave to amend and denied the States motions to dismiss The court explained that the plaintiffs claims regarding the 2011 plans were not moot because inter alia the plaintiffs continued to be harmed by them The court also ordered that the 2013 plans which included Plan C235 be used for the 2014 elections The plaintiffs then filed their amended complaints including claims related to both the 2011 and 2013 plans Most plaintiffs included claims that Plan C235 violated  2 of the VRA and the 14th and 15th Amendments
The Texas District Court held trials on the 2011 plans in 2014 and found that they violated certain aspects of  2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment In the ongoing litigation the plaintiffs contended that the 2013 plans including Plan C235 included some of the same elements that the court determined were the result of discriminatory intent or statutory or constitutional violations as in the 2011 plans
In August 2017 the Texas District Court issued an interlocutory order regarding the plaintiffs C235 claims It found that the racially discriminatory intent and effects identified in the 2011 plans carried through to the 2013 plans where the redistricting lines remained the same It explained that the legislature had adopted the courts interim plans which included C235 as part of a litigation strategy that was designed to insulate the plans from any further challenge The legislature had not engaged in any deliberative process to remove the discriminatory elements from the plans before adopting them but instead intentionally furthered and continued the discrimination in the existing plans
The court also concluded that the configurations of CD 27 and CD 35 under Plan C235 violated  2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment As to CD 27 though the court had found in 2012 that this district did not reflect a racially discriminatory purpose because it was not possible to create an additional Latino opportunity district in the region the Texas legislature had still engaged in vote dilution Regarding CD 35 the court stated that while C235 was enacted in 2013 the challenged district boundaries that it reflected were drawn in 2011 and found to violate  2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment The court explained that the Texas legislature did not engage in any meaningful effort to cleanse the discriminatory elements from the 2013 plan before it was adopted and in fact intended to maintain that discrimination in enacting the plan in substantially the same form 
The court additionally found that the plaintiffs had proven a  2 results violation as to CD 27 HD 32 and HD 34 and a racial gerrymandering claim as to HD 90
The courts order directed the Texas Attorney General to issue a written advisory within three days as to whether the legislature would convene a special session to address the issue of redistricting If the legislature did not plan to hold a special session the parties were ordered to appear before the court to prepare remedial redistricting plans

On March 6 2017 President Trump issued Executive Order No 13780 EO2 Section 2c of EO2 directed that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO1 be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of the order citing a need for time to establish adequate standards to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists Section 6a directed that applications for refugee status and travel of refugees into the United States under the United States Refugee Admissions Program USRAP be suspended for 120 days from the effective date to review the adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures Section 6b suspended the entry of any individual under USRAP once 50000 refugees have entered the United States in fiscal year 2017 The effective date of the order was March 16 2017 EO2 was subject to swift litigation as well
On June 14 just before Section 2c of EO2 was by its terms set to expire President Trump issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials declaring the effective date of each enjoined provision of EO2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision The government sought review in both cases making arguments both on the merits of the cases and on procedural issues
In a per curiam opinion issued simultaneously with an order granting certiorari the Court granted the governments applications for a stay of the preliminary injunction with respect to Sections 6a and b of Executive Order 13780 EO2 thereby allowing enforcement of those provisions Under the Courts ruling the government may enforce Section 6a except as to any individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States nor may such an individual be excluded under Section 6b

A divided 5th Circuit affirmed the district courts ruling upholding Unit 1s designation as critical habitat The court rejected the Landowners argument that the FWS had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in making this designation on the theory that Unit 1 was not presently habitable nor essential to species conservation Explaining that land need not be habitable to be considered essential under 16 USC  15325Aii of the Endangered Species Act ESA the court deferred to the agencys interpretation of that term The majority also held that the FWS had not acted unreasonably in interpreting the ESA to not contain a requirement that land be currently habitable by a species to be designated as critical habitat
The 5th Circuit also held that the FWS had not made an arbitrary and capricious decision under 16 USC  1533b2 in not excluding Unit 1 from the critical habitat based on economic impacts and that this determination was not reviewable in federal court

The appeals court explained that because the agreement was capable of two reasonable interpretations the district court was correct in finding ambiguity Under California law it was also proper to construe the ambiguity against the drafter particularly since it was a contract of adhesion Further it was a reasonable interpretation of the agreement to conclude that it covered legal disputes including classwide claims not just individual ones By accepting this interpretation the district court had found the requisite contractual basis for agreement to class arbitration under StoltNielsen SA v AnimalFeeds Intl Corp 559 US 662 2010

After an audit W2E filed a Form 8K reporting total impairment of its intangible assets and valuing its total assets at 370552 Lorenzos secretary alerted him via email about the amended filings and Lorenzo contacted the Charles Vista brokers about them Nearly two weeks later Lorenzo emailed two potential investors several key points about W2Es pending debenture offering but rather than even mentioning the devaluation of W2Es intangible assets he assured both that the offering came with 3 layers of protection which were 10 million in confirmed assets purchase orders and LOIs for over 43 million in orders and Charles Vista has agreed to raise additional monies to repay the debenture holders if necessary One of these emails stated it had been sent at the request of Lorenzos boss and the other stated it was sent at the request of another broker with the firm Lorenzos name and title were at the bottom of both emails
The SEC charged Lorenzo his boss and Charles Vista with violating three securitiesfraud provisions Section 17a1 of the Securities Act of 1933 Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5 Lorenzos boss and Charles Vista settled the charges against them but Lorenzo proceeded to resolution before the agency An ALJ found that Lorenzo had willfully violated all three provisions of the Securities and Exchange Acts by his misrepresentations to investors On review the full Commission sustained the ALQs decision and Lorenzo appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit which upheld the Commissions findings as to two of the provisions but reversed as to its finding that he violated Rule 10b5b That provision prohibits the making of materially false statements in connection with the purchase or sale of securities A majority of the DC Circuit panel found that because Lorenzos boss not Lorenzo himself retained ultimate authority over the statements Lorenzo did not violate that provision under the US Supreme Courts definition of maker of false statements in Janus Capital Group Inc v First Derivative Traders 564 US 135 2011

After a hearing the magistrate judge held 1 the arbitration clause manifested an intent to have an arbitrator decide questions of arbitrability 2 there is a reasonable construction of the arbitration clause that would call for arbitration in this dispute and 3 the standard for determining whether equitable estoppel is appropriate requires arbitration against both signatories and nonsignatories to the Dealer Agreement
The district court vacated the magistrate judges order and held that the court could decide the question of arbitrability and that the dispute was not arbitrable because the plain language of the arbitration clause expressly excluded suits that involved requests for injunctive relief The court declined to reach the question of equitable estoppel Schein appealed to the Fifth Circuit
In the Fifth Circuit courts must look first to whether the parties clearly and unmistakably intended to delegate the question of arbitrability to an arbitrator If they did the motion to compel arbitration should be granted in almost all cases except where the argument that the claim at hand is within the scope of the arbitration agreement is wholly groundless This standard requires consideration of whether there is a plausible argument for the arbitrability of the dispute If there is no such plausible argument the district court may decide the gateway issue of arbitrability despite a valid delegation clause

Three months later the court denied his motion for reconsideration rejecting his proposed damages models Lambert timely filed a petition under Rule 23f for permission to appeal the district courts orders denying the motion for reconsideration and granting the motion for class decertification to the 9th Circuit which conditionally granted his petition
A threejudge panel of the 9th Circuit held that Lamberts Rule 23f petition for class certification had been timely filed with the appellate court The court explained that because Rule 23fs 14day deadline was procedural rather than jurisdictional equitable exceptions such as tolling could apply It also held that filing a motion for reconsideration before the Rule 23f deadline would toll the deadline The panel further held that other circumstances could toll the deadline In this case Lambert had informed the district court of his intention to file a motion for reconsideration within Rule 23fs 14day window and had submitted the filing within the tenday time frame set by that court The panel concluded that under these circumstances the deadline should be tolled and Lamberts motion for reconsideration should be considered timely filed with the Ninth Circuit while recognizing that a number of other circuits would likely reach the opposite conclusion

HHS contracts with fiscal intermediaries to reimburse healthcare service providers for services rendered to Medicare Part A patients These intermediaries make an initial payment based on an estimate of the cost of services provided and are later adjusted based on actual cost reports
The Medicare Act authorizes reimbursement adjustments to increase payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high number of lowincome patients The rate of adjustment is calculated in part based on the number of patient days for patients entitled to benefits under part A of Medicare In 2012 HHS sought to interpret this phrase as including patient days for patients entitled to benefits under Part C of Medicare as well Including Part C days in the adjustment calculus would result in lower reimbursement rates which translates into hundreds of millions of dollars
The plaintiff hospitals challenged the rate adjustment in the Provider Reimbursement Review Board as required by statute The Board concluded that it lacked authority to resolve the issue which triggered expedited review before the federal district court The district court granted summary judgment to HHS finding that the rate adjustment was an interpretive rule under the Administrative Procedure Act APA and thus was exempt from the APAs noticeandcomment requirement for new rules The hospitals appealed and the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit reversed finding that the adjustment was not merely an interpretive rule and that HHS violated the Medicare Act by promulgating the rule without providing notice and the opportunity for comment

Robert H. Gray,Robert Wilkie,"The Agent Orange Act of 1991 was intended to make it easier for US veterans who were injured by Agent Orange the toxic herbicide used during the Vietnam War to obtain disability benefits The Act provides that to obtain benefits veterans need only show that they served in the Republic of Vietnam during a 13year period and that they developed any one of several diseases associated with Agent Orange
In 2016 the Department of Veterans Affairs VA changed its policy to allow only veterans who set foot on Vietnamese soil or served in the countrys inland waterways to be eligible for benefits under the Act This change effectively excludes US Navy veterans such as the petitioner in this case who served in Vietnams ports harbors and bays which are definitionally excluded from inland waterways
The crux of the dispute in this case is that the VA made this policy change by revising the manual in which it publishes its policies and procedures for resolving benefits claims Petitioner Robert Gray challenged the new policy in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit relying on 38 USC  502 which gives that court authority to review challenges to rules and policies issued by the VA before the rules are actually enforced The Federal Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim because the challenged policy was merely a revision of the manual and did not amount to rulemaking that carries the force of law As such it falls outside the scope of  502

When the officers arrived at the residence they knocked on the door but received no answer Through a side window the officers spoke with Emmons wife and convinced her to open the door so they could perform a welfare check As officers were speaking with her an unidentified man told Emmons to back away from the window

Notably the VA did not grant Kisor relief under Section 3156c which authorizes the agency to reconsider a previously denied claim in the event that it receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim This provision is more favorable to veterans because it provides for a retroactive effective date for any benefits awarded whereas benefits granted under Section 3156a are effective only on the date the application to reopen was filed
The VAs decision technically made by the Board of Veterans Appeals relied on the meaning of the term relevant as used in 38 CFR  3156c1 The VA found that the additional documents Kisors Form 214 and the Combat History document did not qualify as relevant for purposes of this section because it did not suggest or better yet establish that petitioner has PTSD as a current disability In the VAs view records are not relevant when they are not outcome determinative

Bradley Weston Taggart,"Shelley A. Lorenzen, et al.","In the words of the Ninth Circuit decision below this case arises out of a complex set of bankruptcy proceedings
Petitioner Bradley Taggart is a real estate developer who owned 25 interest in Sherwood Park Business Center SPBC Respondents Terry Emmert and Keith Jehnke also each owned a 25 interest in SPBC In 2007 Taggart purported to transfer his share of SPBC to his attorney John Berman
Emmert and Jehnke sued Taggart and Berman in Oregon state court alleging that the transfer violated SPBCs operating agreement by not allowing Emmert and Jehnke the right of first refusal Emmert and Jehnke also sought attorneys fees Taggart moved to dismiss the claim and filed a counterclaim for attorneys fees
In November 2009 shortly before the case went to trial Taggart filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition The statecourt action was stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy petition and in February 2010 Taggart received his discharge in the bankruptcy proceedings
After the discharge Emmert and Jehnke represented by attorney Stuart Brown continued the statecourt action Taggart was largely absent from subsequent proceedings although Berman renewed his motion to dismiss on Taggarts behalf at the close of evidence After a trial the state court ruled in favor of Emmert and Jehnke and unwound the transfer of Taggarts share of SPBC to Berman and expelled Taggart from the company The state court entered a judgment that allowed any party to petition for attorneys fees which led to yet more complicated litigation in state and federal courts
Brown the attorney for Emmert and Jehnke filed a petition for attorneys fees in state court on behalf of SPBC Emmert and Jehnke against both Berman and Taggart but limiting fees against Taggart to those incurred after the date of Taggarts bankruptcy discharge The petition notified the court of Taggarts bankruptcy discharge but argued he could still be liable for attorneys fees on the theory that Taggart had returned to the fray
While the attorneys fee petition was pending in state court Taggart sought to reopen his bankruptcy proceeding in bankruptcy court Once reopened Taggart asked the court to hold Brown Jehnke Emmert and SPBC collectively the Creditors in contempt for violating the bankruptcy discharge by seeking an award of attorneys fees against him in the state court action
The state court ruled that Taggart had returned to the fray as a matter of law so he could be held liable for attorneys fees incurred after his bankruptcy Taggart timely appealed the statecourt determination
Subsequently the bankruptcy court denied Taggarts motion for contempt agreeing with the state court that Taggart had returned to the fray On appeal the district court reversed finding that Taggarts actions did not constitute a return to the fray and thus the discharge injunction barred the claim against him for attorneys fees The district court remanded for a determination whether the Creditors had knowingly violated the discharge injunction in seeking attorneys fees On remand the bankruptcy court found they had knowingly violated the discharge injunction and thus held them in contempt On appeal the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel BAP reversed the bankruptcy courts finding of contempt finding they had a good faith belief that the discharge injunction did not apply to their attorneys fee claim
Back in state court the state appellate court found that Taggarts actions did not constitute a return to the fray and thus reversed the state trial court as to its ruling on attorneys fees As a result the federal district court and the state appellate court both agreed that the Creditors could not pursue attorneys fees against Taggart and the BAPs ruling freed them from being held in contempt for knowingly violating the discharge injunction
The Ninth Circuit affirmed the BAPs opinion holding that the Creditors did not knowingly violate the discharge injunction and thus could not be held in contempt because they had a subjective goodfaith belief that the discharge injunction did not apply to their statecourt claim for attorneys fees

It is customary for the target company to issue a statement to shareholders recommending that they either accept or reject the tender offer Before issuing such a statement Emulex hired Goldman Sachs to determine whether the proposed merger agreement would be fair to shareholders Goldman Sachs determined that it would be fair despite a belowaverage merger premium and Emulex issued a statement consistent with that determination Some of the shareholders were unhappy with the mergers terms and brought a class action lawsuit against Emulex Avago Merger Sub and the Emulex Board of Directors alleging violations of federal securities laws
The district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice finding that the lead plaintiffs claim under Section 14e did not plead the requisite mental culpability for claims under that section the separate claim under Section 14d failed because that section does not establish a private right of action for shareholders confronted with a tender offer and its Section 20a claim because its first two claims were insufficient

18 USC  924c contains both an elements clause and a residual clause The elements clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it has as an element the use attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another and the residual clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense In Dimaya the Court addressed and invalidated a residual clause identical to the residual clause in  924c but did not address the elements clause Thus the Fifth Circuit held the residual clause in 924c unconstitutionally vague under Dimaya but did not invalidate the elements clause in that section As a result of this holding the Fifth Circuit affirmed its prior judgment as to the Hobbs Act robbery count but vacated as to the aiding and abetting conspiracy count because the former relies on the elements clause while the latter relies on the residual clause

On December 18 2015 McDonough filed a lawsuit under 42 USC  1983 claiming that Smith and the other defendants violated his due process rights by fabricating evidence and using it against him before a grand jury and in two trials The defendants filed a motion to dismiss claiming among other things that McDonoughs claim was barred by the threeyear statute of limitations because the allegedly fabricated evidence had been disclosed to McDonough over three years before he filed his Section 1983 claim
The district court granted the motions to dismiss as to McDonoughs due process claims citing the statute of limitations The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed finding that the precedent in that circuit established that the statute of limitations begins to run on a fabrication of evidence claim when the plaintiff has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action The Second Circuit acknowledged that Third Ninth and Tenth Circuits have held otherwise but expressly disagreed with those decisions

"Fort Bend County, Texas",Lois M.

Davis filed a charge with the Texas Workforce Commission alleging sexual harassment and retaliation While the charge was pending Davis allegedly informed her supervisor of a specific Sunday she could not work due to a previous religious commitment and the supervisor did not approve the absence Davis attended the event and did not report to work and Fort Bend terminated her employment
Davis submitted to the Commission an intake questionnaire in which she wrote in the word religion next to a checklist labeled Employment Harms or Actions but did not amend her charge of discrimination or explain the note The Commission informed Davis that it had made a preliminary decision to dismiss her charge and issued a righttosue letter Davis filed her lawsuit in federal district court alleging both retaliation and religious discrimination under Title VII The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county on all claims
The Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court as to the retaliation claim but reversed and remanded as to her religious discrimination claim finding genuine disputes of material fact that warranted a trial On remand Fort Bend argued for the first time that Davis had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies on the religious discrimination claim as required by Title VII The district court agreed finding that administrative exhaustion is a jurisdictional prerequisite in Title VII cases Because subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by failure to challenge it the district court dismissed Daviss religious discrimination claim with prejudice
Title VII requires plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies by filing formal charges with the EEOC There is no consensus within the Fifth Circuit whether this requirement is a jurisdictional requirement which may be raised at any point and cannot be waived or merely a prerequisite to suit and thus subject to waiver Relying on the Supreme Courts decision in Arbaugh v Y amp H Corp 546 US 500 2006 in which the Court held that the Title VIIs statutory limitation of covered employers to those with 15 or more employees was not jurisdictional the Fifth Circuit held that the administrative exhaustion requirement was also not jurisdictional This holding is consistent with holdings in the First Second Third Sixth Seventh Tenth and DC Circuits but inconsistent with holdings by the Fourth Ninth and Eleventh Circuits

The Dutra Group,Christopher Batterton,"Respondent Christopher Batterton was a deckhand on a vessel owned and operated by the the petitioner Dutra Group While Batterton was working on the vessel a hatch cover blew open and crushed his hand The hatch cover blew open because the vessel lacked a particular exhaust mechanism the lack of which made the vessel unseaworthy as a matter of law
The district court denied Dutra Groups motion to strike the claim for punitive damages and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed 
In Evich v Morris 819 F2d 256 9th Cir 1987 the Ninth Circuit held that punitive damages are available under general maritime law for claims of unseaworthiness as distinguished from Jones Act claims where punitive damages are unavailable Dutra Group argues that Evich is implicitly overruled by the US Supreme Courts decision in Miles v Apex Marine Corp 498 US 19 1990 which holds that loss of society damages are unavailable in a general maritime action for wrongful death and lost future earnings are unavailable in a general maritime survival action
The Ninth Circuit found unpersuasive Dutra Groups argument finding that the Court in Miles considered only damages for loss of society and of future earnings not punitive damages While Miles does limit recovery for pecuniary loss punitive damages are not pecuniary loss which means simply loss of money Thus Miles left undisturbed the Ninth Circuits opinion in Evich

Glover moved to suppress all evidence from the stop arguing that the stop violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures According to Glover the police officer lacked reasonable suspicion to pull him over The state argued that a law enforcement officer may infer that the owner of a vehicle is the one driving the vehicle absent information to the contrary and the knowledge that the owner has a revoked license combined with that inference gives rise to reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop

The district court again dismissed the lawsuit for failing to meet the Fifth Third pleading standard and because a prudent fiduciary could reasonably find their proposed alternative likely to cause more harm than good The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed finding that when a drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund is inevitable it is far more plausible that a prudent fiduciary would prefer to limit the effects of the stocks artificial inflation on the ESOPs beneficiaries through prompt disclosure

Atlantic Ritchfield Company,"Gregory A. Christian, et al.","This case arises from Montanas Anaconda Smelter sitethe location of a large copper concentrating and smelting operation that started in 1884 and expanded to other nearby areas in 1902 In 1977 Atlantic Richfield purchased Anaconda Smelter and it shut down smelter activities in 1980 The smelter operations over the almostcentury of operations caused high concentrations of arsenic lead copper cadmium and zinc to contaminate soil groundwater and surface water In 1983 the EPA prioritized the Anaconda Smelter site as a Superfund site working with Atlantic Richfield to address the contamination Since then Atlantic Richfield has worked with the EPA for 35 years to remediate the site at a cost of approximately 470 million
In 2008 landowners within the Anaconda Superfund site sued Atlantic Richfield in Montana state court alleging that the smelter operations between 1884 and 1980 had caused damage to their properties Atlantic Richfield raised no objections to the plaintiffs claims of loss of use and enjoyment of property diminution of value incidental and consequential damages and annoyance and discomfort However it did object to the commonlaw claim for restoration damages
To establish a claim for restoration damages in Montana plaintiffs must prove that they will actually use the award to clean up the site The plaintiffs in this case alleged that restoration of their property requires work in excess of what the EPA required of Atlantic Richfield in its selected remedy Atlantic Richfield moved for summary judgment arguing that the restoration claim constituted a challenge to the EPAs remedy and thus was jurisdictionally barred by CERCLA  113 which deprives courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to EPAselected remedies Atlantic Richfield also argued that the landowners are potentially responsible parties and thus must seek EPA approval under 42 USC  9622e6 of CERCLA before engaging in remedial action Finally Atlantic Richfield argued that CERCLA preempted state commonlaw claims for restoration
The trial court held that CERCLA permitted plaintiffs claim for restoration damages and Atlantic Richfield sought a writ of supervisory control from the Montana Supreme Court which the court granted Over a dissent the Supreme Court of Montana rejected all three of Atlantic Richfields arguments affirming the trial courts decision permitting the plaintiffs to proceed to a jury trial on their restoration claim

Intel moved to dismiss the complaint as timebarred under 29 USC  11132 which provides that an action under Section 1104 may not be commenced more than three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation The district court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and ordered discovery for the question of the statute of limitations After discovery the district court found no genuine dispute as to any material fact that Sulyma had actual knowledge of the investments more than three years before filing the action and it granted summary judgment for Intel Sulyma appealed
The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that actual knowledge does not mean that the plaintiff knew that the underlying action violated ERISA or that the underlying action even occurred only that the plaintiff was actually aware of the nature of the alleged breach For a Section 1104 action this means the plaintiff must have known that the defendant had acted and that those acts were imprudent The Ninth Circuit reversed the district courts grant of summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings

At McKinneys capital sentencing hearing before a judge a psychologist testified that he had diagnosed McKinney with PTSD resulting from the horrific childhood McKinney had suffered The psychologist further testified that witnessing violence could trigger McKinneys childhood trauma and produce diminished capacity The trial judge credited the psychologists testimony but under Arizona law at the time the judge was prohibited from considering nonstatutory mitigating evidence that the judge found to be unconnected to the crime Because McKinneys PTSD was not connected to the burglaries the judge could not consider it mitigating evidence and thus sentenced him to death

"Department of Homeland Security, et al.","Regents of the University of California, et al.","In 2012 the US Department of Homeland Security DHS adopted a programknown as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACAto postpone the deportation of undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children and to assign them work permits allowing them to obtain social security numbers pay taxes and become part of mainstream society in the United States
In 2017 after the national election when the Trump administration replaced the Obama administration DHS began a phaseout of DACA The parties do not dispute the authority of a new administration to replace old policies with new policies but the plaintiffs in this and related challenges allege that the new administration terminated DACA based on a mistake of law rather than in compliance with the law Specifically the Trump administration terminated DACA based on a conclusion that the Obama administration had created DACA without proper statutory authority and with no established enddate and thus that it was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch
The plaintiffs in this case and the related cases challenged this conclusion of law alleging that the recission of DACA violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was arbitrary and capricious and because it was a substantive rule that did not comply with the APAs noticeandcomment requirements The challengers also alleged that the recission deprived DACA recipients of constitutionally protected liberty and property interests without due process of law and violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was motivated by discriminatory animus
The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the governments motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction finding that the DACA recission was not committed to agency discretion by law and that there was law to apply Further the Ninth Circuit granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction restoring DACA finding that the plaintiffs were likely to win on the merits of their arguments they would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief the balance of equities tips in the plaintiffs favor and the injunction is in the public interest

Several abortion clinics and doctors challenged Act 620 and while that challenge was pending in the district court the US Supreme Court struck down a nearly identical Texas law in Whole Womens Health v Hellerstedt WWH finding that the Texas law imposed an undue burden on a womans right to have an abortion while bringing about no healthrelated benefit and serving no relevant credentialing function The district court hearing the challenge to Act 620 accordingly declared Act 620 facially invalid and permanently enjoined its enforcement
The district court made detailed findings of fact and determined that admitting privileges also do not serve any relevant credentialing function and that physicians are sometimes denied privileges  for reasons unrelated to medical competency The district court further determined that the law would drastically burden womens right to choose abortions

King then filed a lawsuit against the United States and both FBI agents alleging that the agents violated his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights by conducting an unreasonable seizure and by using excessive force In general the United States and its agents are immune from liability under the principle of sovereign immunity The Federal Tort Claims Act FTCA waives sovereign immunity in specific situations and the plaintiff bringing an FTCA claim bears the burden of showing his claim falls within such situations The FTCA also contains a judgment bar provision that precludes a plaintiff from bringing additional claims concerning the same subject matter as an FTCA claim after a judgment is entered on the FTCA claim
The district court found that King failed to prove one of the six requirements for FTCA to apply and therefore that it lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction to hear Kings claim against the United States The court further held that the defendant agents were entitled to qualified immunity and granted summary judgment in their favor The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed finding the FTCA judgment bar does not preclude Kings remaining claims because the court did not reach the merits of the FTCA claims and that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity

In the meantime Lange filed a civil suit asking the court to overturn the suspension of his license and the civil court granted the petition after determining Langes arrest was unlawful The court reasoned that the hot pursuit doctrine did not justify the warrantless entry because when the officer entered Langes garage all the officer knew was that Lange had been playing his music too loudly and had honked his horn unnecessarily which are infractions not felonies
Based on the inconsistent findings of the courts Lange petitioned for transfer to the California Court of Appeal which concluded that Langes arrest was lawful and affirmed the judgment of conviction

"Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.","New York, et al.","On July 21 2020 President Donald Trump announced that the population figures used to determine the apportionment of Congress would in a reversal of longstanding practice exclude noncitizens who are not lawfully present in the United States To implement this new policy the President ordered the Secretary of Commerce to provide him two sets of numbers for each state The first number was the total population as determined in the 2020 census and the second the total population as determined in the 2020 census minus the number of aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status The President left it to the Secretary to determine how to calculate the latter figure but since the 2020 census did not not collect information regarding citizenship status let alone legal immigration status in this country it remained unclear how the Secretary would obtain that number
Immediately after the President filed the memorandum two sets of plaintiffsa coalition of 22 States and DC 15 cities and counties and the US Conference of Mayors the Governmental Plaintiffs and a coalition of nongovernmental organizationschallenged the decision to exclude illegal aliens from the apportionment base for Congress on the ground that it violates the Constitution statutes governing the census and apportionment and other laws
The federal district court found for the plaintiffs concluding that by directing the Secretary to provide two sets of numbers one derived from the census and one not and announcing that it is the policy of the United States to use the latter to apportion the House the memorandum violated the statutory scheme In addition the court concluded that the memorandum violated the statute governing apportionment because so long as they reside in the United States illegal aliens qualify as persons in a State as Congress used those words

Americans for Prosperity Foundation,"Rob Bonta, Attorney General of California","The California Attorney Generals office has a policy requiring charities to provide the state on a confidential basis information about their major donors purportedly to help the state protect consumers from fraud and the misuse of their charitable contributions Petitioner Americans for Prosperity and the petitioner in the consolidated case Thomas More Law Center either failed to file or filed redacted lists of their major donors with the California Attorney Generals office despite filing complete lists with the federal Internal Revenue Service as required by federal law
In response to demands by the California Attorney General that they file the lists the organizations filed a lawsuit alleging that the filing requirement unconstitutionally burdened their First Amendment right to free association by deterring individuals from financially supporting them The organizations provided evidence that although the state is required to keep donor names private the states database was vulnerable to hacking and many donor names were repeatedly released to the public Based in part on this finding the district court granted both organizations motions for a preliminary injunction and then ultimately found for them after a trial holding that the organizations and their donors were entitled to First Amendment protection under the principles established in the Supreme Courts decision in NAACP v Alabama In so holding the court reasoned that the governments filing demands were not the least restrictive means of obtaining the information and thus did not satisfy strict scrutiny
A panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed based on its conclusion that exacting scrutiny rather than strict scrutiny was the appropriate standard and exacting scrutiny requires that the government show that the disclosure and reporting requirements are justified by a compelling government interest and that the legislation is narrowly tailored to serve that interest

Territory of Guam,United States,"The United States captured the island of Guam from Spain in 1898 during the SpanishAmerican War From 1903 the United States maintained military rule until the passage of the Guam Organic Act in 1950 which formally transferred power from the United States to Guams newly formed civilian government Guam remains an unincorporated territory of the United States
In the 1940s the Navy constructed and operated the Ordot Dump for the disposal of municipal and military waste allegedly including munitions and chemicals such as DDT and Agent Orange and continued to use the landfill throughout the Korean and Vietnam Wars The Ordot Dump lacked basic environmental safeguards and as a result contaminants were released into the Lonfit River which ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean
In 1983 the Environmental Protection Agency EPA added the Ordot Dump to its National Priorities List and in 1988 it designated the Navy as a potentially responsible party However because the Navy had relinquished sovereignty over the island Guam remained the owner and operator of the Ordot Dump As such the EPA repeatedly ordered Guam to propose plans for containing and disposing of waste at the landfill
In 2002 the EPA sued Guam under the Clean Water Act asking the court to require Guam to comply with the Act in part by submitting plans and a compliance schedule for a cover system of the Ordot Dump and by completing construction of the cover system The EPA and Guam agreed that Guam would pay a civil penalty close the Ordot Dump and design a cover system Guam closed the Ordot Dump in 2011
In 2017 Guam sued the United States alleging that the Navy was responsible for the Ordot Dumps contamination and was thus responsible for the costs of closing and remediating the landfill Guams claims rested on two provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA Section 107 allows for a costrecovery action and Section 113f allows for a contribution action The statute of limitations for the former action is six years compared to only three for the latter The district court concluded that Guams agreement with the EPA did not trigger section 113 so Guam could maintain its section 107 claim against the United States The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed
